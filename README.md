This repo is complementing the [hashFrag](https://github.com/de-Boer-Lab/hashFrag/tree/main) repo. It contains the code used to do some of the analysis in our hashFrag paper (to keep the other repo dedicated as a tool). 

The [Usage](https://github.com/de-Boer-Lab/hashFrag-PaperCode/blob/main/Usage.ipynb) notebook contains instructions on constructing and analyzing all by all similarity matrix.
The [train_and_track_NNs](https://github.com/de-Boer-Lab/hashFrag-PaperCode/blob/main/train_and_track_NNs.ipynb) notebook contains instructions on training the DREAM models and tracking their performance on the train and test data during model training.
